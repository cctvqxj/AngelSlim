"""Quantizer scales -- the only trainable state (weights are frozen).

The trained scales are the ONLY thing worth persisting (weights stay the frozen FP
dist-checkpoint), so we never snapshot full model/optimizer state -- just the tiny scale
tensors, optionally every N steps. We don't support resume-from-scales (no checkpoint
training by design); to seed scales use load_initial_scales below.

* save_scales        : per-rank file of the trainable scales (optionally step-tagged).
* load_initial_scales: seed scales from an external/PTQ file, matched by name
  (the design decision is to read precomputed scales rather than run PTQ in-framework).

External scale file: a torch-saved dict {qualified_name: tensor}, where qualified_name
matches a model buffer/parameter, e.g.
  "...weight_q.scheme.block_store.ref"   (NVFP4 weight reference scale)
  "...act_q.scheme.store.scale"          (calibrated activation scale)

"""How a scale tensor must live under mcore parallelism.

A ScaleScheme, knowing its own axis/granularity AND the host module's parallel
layout, emits a ``ParallelSpec`` describing whether the scale param is:
  * SHARDED   : aligned with a TP/EP shard axis -> each rank holds a slice,
                gradients are local, no sync needed (cheapest + cleanest).
  * REPLICATED: a per-tensor / replicated-axis scale -> every rank holds a full
                copy; gradients are PARTIAL and MUST be all-reduced over the
                listed groups, or ranks silently diverge.
See the design discussion (TP/EP/CP scale correctness matrix) for which case
each (granularity x host) combination falls into.

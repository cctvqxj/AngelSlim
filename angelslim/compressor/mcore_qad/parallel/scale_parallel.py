"""Attach mcore parallel attributes / grad-sync to scale parameters.

Given a Quantizer and the ParallelSpec its scheme produced:
  * SHARDED   -> tag scale params as tensor-model-parallel (so dist-checkpoint
                 reshards them and mcore treats them as partitioned).
  * REPLICATED-> register a backward hook that all-reduces the scale gradient over
                 the listed process groups (TP and/or CP), so replicas stay in sync
                 (otherwise per-tensor / replicated-axis scales silently diverge).
  * EXPERT    -> handled by EP module placement; TP sharding (if any) still applies
                 via the column/row spec, so nothing special here.

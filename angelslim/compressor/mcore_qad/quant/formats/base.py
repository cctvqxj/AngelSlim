"""Axis 1 -- Numeric Format: the discrete grid a real value snaps to.

A Format knows ONLY about the representable grid and how to round a *normalized*
(already scale-divided) value onto it, with the right gradient. It knows nothing
about scales, granularity, tensors, or parallelism. This separation is what lets
NVFP4/MXFP4/INT4/INT8 coexist without special-casing.

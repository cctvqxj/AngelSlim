"""Training loss: LM (default) + optional distillation, each with its own weight.

    total = lm_weight * lm_loss + distill_weight * distill_loss

* lm_loss     : next-token cross-entropy (always available; default weight 1.0).
* distill_loss: teacher/student logit match (default weight 0.0 -> off). Types:
    - kl    : forward KL(teacher || student)
    - rkl   : reverse KL(student || teacher)
    - cakld : Contextual Asymmetric KL -- per-token mix of fwd/rev KL weighted by the
              teacher's confidence on the gold label (conf*rkl + (1-conf)*fkl).
  `temperature` scales the softmaxes (KD-style, *T^2).

`distill_topk` (0 = full vocab) restricts the distill KL to the teacher's top-k tokens,
renormalized over that support. This is what makes large-vocab distillation fit: the
KL then never materializes/retains a [tokens, vocab] tensor (only [tokens, k]), which the
full path must keep for backward. For QAD (student ~= teacher) the top-k carries ~all the
mass, so it tracks the full KL closely. NOTE: top-k only shrinks the DISTILL term; an
exact LM cross-entropy still needs the full vocab (so under lm_weight>0 the LM term keeps
the [tokens, vocab] cost -- use TP/vocab-parallel for that, not top-k).

The distill term needs a teacher forward; the trainer runs a quant-OFF pass to get it
only when `needs_teacher` is true. Everything is computed in fp32 on causal-shifted,
non-padding tokens (bf16 full-vocab softmax can underflow and make KL grads Inf/NaN).
